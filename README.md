## Summary
Software Developer and Oceanographer. Currently I work as technology and systems manager, leading a team of 17 people and developing systems to hydrological and meteorological applications. 

I have 11 years of experience as computer developer. I have experience with web programming, mobile development, Linux administration, relational databases, data analysis, statistics, time series manipulation, matrix and specialized data manipulation, and geoprocessing.

Good communication, teamwork, problem solving instinct, proactive and determined. My biggest motivation is to encounter complex challenges. Those in which it is necessary to understand the process and know the variables to solve the problem. Nothing is impossible, because for everything there is a way to do it. 

I pass my last seven years working on a hydrological complex project with four core parts: rain data assimilation, numerical modelling, data delivery, and web tools to interpretate and analyse model results. See my work experiences to best understand this project. 

I'm currently looking for a Data Engineer or Web Developer position, where I think I'll have my best performance.

## English Level
Currently, I am studying on Open English school. It has a course with 8 English levels. Actually I passed level 4, and I'm studying level 5 to get B1 certificate.

### Cybersecurity motivation - Web system migration to AWS Cloud
_Fractal Engenharia -> Sep-2021 - Mar-2022_

Project: [SIG²A](https://siga.fractaleng.com.br)

**Web system migration from Linode cloud to AWS cloud.**

###
##### _Project Overview_
A customer and your TI team have analyzed the system and has suggests several improvements, either cybersecurity as infrastruct. After our analyse, we decide that the best choice was to migrate to AWS cloud and setup AWS services to specific purposes.

We worked is six different areas:
- User authentication and data security improvements. The solution was integrate an authentication system that comprised: multi-factor authentication, password policy, password change after perior, account lockout after attempts;
- Periodic vulnerability assesment to find weakness and flaws on system;
- Traffic inspection and web application firewall (WAF);
- Proper isolation of application (web server, database, app server);
- Data-at-rest encryptation to protect customer data;
- Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan to minimize downtime in case of failure.

Currently this project has been completed and is in production. All services are working properly.

##### _Learning Outcomes_
From this project, I learned a such AWS services features and how it works. On the technical side, about AWS services, I learned about costs and how optimize, setup of security groups rules, how to encrypt existing EBS volumes properly, ALB and WAF setup, features and rules, Buckets and users security.
I also strengthened my skills involving clouding services and application, encouraging me to migrate another applications or to start a new project with a serverless approach.

Regarding project management, I also learned how to think about and make right choices to avoid that your project stay sticked to a specific cloud forever.

### DAMS App
_Fractal Engenharia -> April-2017 - Present_

Project: [DAMS](https://fractaleng.com.br/solucoes/dams/) 

Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fractalengenharia.DamsApp

**Dam safety Android app for manually monitoring auscultation instruments in hydropower and mining dams.**
###
##### _Project Overview_
Is a engineering project created to monitoring dams auscultation instruments and perform dam structures visual inspection. The app is able to execute a complete auscultation cycle, registering different information about instruments. The main features are: instrument identification by QR Code, reader person name, instrument readings with confirmation, the app works offline saving data in internal smartphone/tablet database (SQLite), take site/field photos, observations, occurrences and instrument maintenance request registers.
The same app is able to execute 'Visual Inspection' of dams, based on form created on SIG²A. The engineer can register structures conditions in site, take photos, and sent information to SIG²A. After auscultation or visual inspection service is completed, all data are sent to web platform (SIG²A) and several PDF reports are generated.

This project was built using Android Studio platform and Java language. The user data is stored using SQLite database. API endpoints from PHP + Symfony Framework.

This project is in production. Currently we have contract with 6 great energy generator groups, monitoring 13 hydro eletric dams, including large, medium and small dimensions dams. Every month more than 1660 auscultation instruments are read at least one time.

##### _Learning Outcomes_
From this project I learned to work with Android SDK advanced properties, like ReciclerView, BaseAdapter, SurfaceHolder, SurfaceView, Fragments, sharedPreferences, SQLite database to internal storage, parsing GPS coordinates, listeners, Volley library to Rest API calls, Gradle packages manager, Android code security and key store, Google Play app publish on alfa, beta and production channels, Google Play account management when Google had required code adjusts and credential's do access app and keep it on Google Play, app optimization and code tests in different devices with different screen sizes, modify and evolve code to works on newer Android versions (this app was launched when last Android version was 5 - Lollipop. Actually was on 11 - Red Velvet Cake), among others learnings.
It is also worth mentioning about learnings in project files organization, both logic as layouts (for different screen sizes), and also about code internalization with tags for different languages.

### AngularJS web platform
_Fractal Engenharia -> April-2017 - Present_

Project: [SIG²A](https://www.fractaleng.com.br/SIGA/user_guide/user/) 


**Modular Single Page application with tools for dam safety, hydrology monitoring and hydrology forecast system.**
Written in AngularJS, and currently in migration to ReactJS with Single SPA library. Backend with PHP Symfony Framework, and Python Django Framework.

###
##### _Project Overview_
SIG²A is a complete web solution to customers visualizing your data, make analysis and to register information about dam security, hydrological river monitoring and river flow predictions to hydroeletric power stations. SIG²A is integrated with DAMS App, SPEHC and RESOP products.

The project is a modular single page application, based on API restful, written in AngularJS and actually in migration to ReactJS with Single-SPA library. Backend is provided by two different projects, as PHP + Symfony Framework, and Python + Django Framework.

Hosted on AWS, has Auth0 authentication service and Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan available.

The project architecture was idealized and developed by me. Currently the platform has 33 modules and I can maintain all them, either JavaScript logic or CSS style. Each module can be considered a different project because its business logic is in Frontend side, written in JavaScript. The most advanced tools comprising numerical calculations and show instruments time series data on graph and spatial information on maps.

SIG²A was built with a version control guideline documentation and every new pull request made, the developer who work on it need to add version description and versioning number.

#### _Learning outcomes_
From this project, and because is a long project, I learned a lot of things. On technical side, I learned how to work properly with a single page application project, best pratices of web programming, javascript and ES6 new features, AngularJS tricks and how to solve problems, how to work with Material Desing library and to explore its html/css features properly, and so on. Because AngularJS large files characteristic, I needed to integrate a lazy loading library to charge static files only when necessary to mantain the best user experience. I also streghtened my skills with git versioning, deploy pipelines and dev/stage/production environments.
Regarding project management, I learned how to work with developers who not want to work with a specific framework (AngularJS is deprecated since 2018). I learned also how to break down tasks within a module into smaller incremental steps.
